* Logic:

Every shell process which calls the init code has a file for its env created in /tmp/
`onion save` - save the environment to the file
`onion wrap x` - save the set changes from the last environment to the file under name x
`onion unwrap x` - undo the set of changes under the name x
`onion show` -- show the colored environment


operations: overwrite






* Example

pid-onion.env
init:
  VAR1=VAL1
  VAR2=VAL2

guix-current:
  VAR2=VAL3:VAL2

guix-profile:
  VAR3=VAL4
  VAR1=VAL5
